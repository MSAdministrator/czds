## What is CZDS?

Each Top Level Domain (TLD) is maintained by a registry operator, who also manages a publicly available list of Second Level Domains (SLDs) and the details needed to resolve those domain names to Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.

The registry operatorâ€™s zone data contains the mapping of domain names, associated name server names, and IP addresses for those name servers. These details are updated by the registry operator for its respective TLDs whenever information changes or a domain name is added or removed.

Each registry operator keeps its zone data in a text file called the Zone File which is updated once every 24 hours.

## Features

- Retrieve Centralized Zone Transfer Files from root DNS servers hosted by ICAAN and other agencies
- Download one or all of the zone files and return data in multiple formats; text, json or a file (default)
- You can now retrieve zone files using multi-threading

## Roadmap

The following are some of the features I am planning on adding but would love to hear everyones thoughts as well.

- Add ability to search based on domain and/or TLD
  - This may include using algorithms like Levenshtein distance, confusables/idna characters, etc.
- Add ability to derive differences between zone files over time
- Add ability to retrieve other contextual external information like WHOIS
- Add ability to save/store data into a database

## Requirements

- You need a CZDS account with ICAAN. You can sign-up [here](https://czds.icann.org)
- Internet access
