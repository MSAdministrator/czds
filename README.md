## What is CZDS?

Each Top Level Domain (TLD) is maintained by a registry operator, who also manages a publicly available list of Second Level Domains (SLDs) and the details needed to resolve those domain names to Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.

The registry operatorâ€™s zone data contains the mapping of domain names, associated name server names, and IP addresses for those name servers. These details are updated by the registry operator for its respective TLDs whenever information changes or a domain name is added or removed.

Each registry operator keeps its zone data in a text file called the Zone File which is updated once every 24 hours.

## Features

- Retrieve Centralized Zone Transfer Files from root DNS servers hosted by ICAAN and other agencies
- Download one or all of the zone files to your local system/disk
- You can now retrieve zone files using multi-threading
